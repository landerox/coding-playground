# Coding Playground

Welcome to my **Coding Playground**! This repository serves as a dedicated space where I explore, practice, and enhance my programming skills through a wide variety of coding challenges. It includes solutions to exercises from multiple platforms such as **Exercism**, **HackerRank**, **LeetCode**, and **CodeChef**, among others.

## Purpose
- Explore and practice problem-solving techniques through diverse challenges.
- Learn and strengthen understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Develop consistent coding habits by tackling exercises from various platforms.

## Platforms Covered
- **Exercism**: Track-based exercises focused on specific programming languages.
- **HackerRank**: Competitive programming challenges on algorithms, data structures, and beyond.
- **LeetCode**: Problems categorized by difficulty, ideal for preparing technical interviews.
- **CodeChef**: Programming contests and custom challenges for competitive programmers.
- **Codewars**: Short, focused challenges (called "kata") to improve skills across various programming languages.
- **GeeksforGeeks (Practice Section)**: A rich resource of programming problems covering fundamentals and interview preparation.
- **CoderByte**: Interactive challenges and coding exercises designed to enhance technical skills.
